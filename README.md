## Description

This project is a proof of concept for a recommender system that queries ads based on a specific interest, 
using various social networks and cloud APIs. The system is designed to be used by a user who is interested 
in a specific topic and wants to find ads related to that topic. 

This has implementations in Python, to query ads from Facebook, Google and TikTok.
